A cleaner for Image File Execution Options hijackers. Each Windows program can be setup to have a different program start together with it, from the 'Image File Execution Options' (IFEO) Registry key. This program acts as a debugger for the host program. If this debugger program is deleted, the host program will not start. All registered debuggers are listed here.

* Compatible with: Windows NT4 and newer *
